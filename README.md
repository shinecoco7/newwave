# Hi, This is Team NewWave! ðŸ‘‹


## Project Title


NewWave
## Description

While keeping in mind the UN14:Life Below Water
,this project is about collecting plastic from the great oceans of our world and also detecing the pH of the oceans.This waste collecting device with pH sensors and monitoring tailored for ocean environments represents a groundbreaking advancement in marine conservation efforts. Engineered to withstand the harsh conditions of the ocean, this device serves as a vital tool in combating marine pollution and preserving oceanic ecosystems. Equipped with state-of-the-art pH sensors, this device is capable of accurately assessing the acidity or alkalinity levels of seawater in real-time, offering valuable insights into ocean health and the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems.
Our project is a device oriented prject where we are using the app for contorlling the machineriers of device and also the data of how much the scraps are cleaned from the body.
